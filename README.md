# 🤖 AI Optimization Playground

![AI Optimization Playground Banner](Images/Banner_AI_Optimization_Playground.png)

This repository is a growing collection of optimization models and scenarios built using [PuLP](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp) and Python.

Each notebook solves a real-world **linear programming (LP)** problem, including:
- ✅ Profit maximization
- 🔻 Cost minimization
- 🔄 What-if scenario testing
- 🎛️ Interactive controls via ipywidgets
- 📦 Visual charts of LP solutions
